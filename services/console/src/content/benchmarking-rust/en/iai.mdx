All three are [support by Bencher](/docs/explanation/adapters/). So why choose Iai?
Iai uses instruction counts instead of wall clock time.
This makes it ideal for [continuous benchmarking](/docs/explanation/continuous-benchmarking/), that is benchmarking in CI.
I would suggest using Iai for continuous benchmarking, especially if you are using shared runners.
It is important to understand that Iai only measures a proxy for what you really care about.
Does going from 1,000 instructions to 2,000 instructions double the latency of your application?
Maybe or maybe not.
For this reason, it can be useful to also run wall clock time based benchmarks in parallel with instruction count based benchmarks.

> üê∞ Iai hasn't been update [in several years](https://github.com/bheisler/iai/commits/main/). So you might consider [using Gungraun](/docs/explanation/adapters/#-rust-gungraun) instead.

## Install Valgrind

Iai uses a tool called [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to collect instruction counts.
Valgrind supports Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS.
However, the macOS support is limited to x86_64 processors as [arm64 (M1, M2, etc) processors are not yet supported](https://github.com/LouisBrunner/valgrind-macos/issues/56).

On Debian run: `sudo apt-get install valgrind`

On macOS (x86_64/Intel chip only): `brew install valgrind`

## Benchmarking FizzBuzz

In order to benchmark our code, we need to create a `benches` directory and add file to contain our benchmarks, `play_game.rs`:

<GameBenchesTree />

Inside of `play_game.rs` add the following code:

<FizzBuzzRefactorBenchesCode />

- Import the `play_game` function from our `game` crate.
- Create a function named `bench_play_game`.
- Run our macro-benchmark inside of a "black box" so the compiler doesn't optimize our code.
- Iterate from `1` to `100` inclusively.
- For each number, call `play_game`, with `print` set to `false`.

Now we need to configure the `game` crate to run our benchmarks.

Add the following to the _bottom_ of your `Cargo.toml` file:

<GameCargoToml />

- `iai`: Add `iai` as a development dependency, since we are only using it for performance testing.
- `bench`: Register `play_game` as a benchmark and set `harness` to `false`, since we will be using Iai as our benchmarking harness.

Now we're ready to benchmark our code, run `cargo bench`:

<BenchPlayGameOutput />

> üê∞ Lettuce turnip the beet! We've got our first benchmark metrics!

Finally, we can rest our weary developer heads...
Just kidding, our users want a new feature!

<FizzBuzzFibonacciRust>
  <PlayGameRustCode />
</FizzBuzzFibonacciRust>

## Benchmarking FizzBuzzFibonacci

Now we can rerun our benchmark:

<BenchPlayGameFibonacciOutput />

Oh, neat! Iai tells us the difference between the estimated cycles of our FizzBuzz and FizzBuzzFibonacci games is `+522.6091%`.
Your numbers will be a little different than mine.
However, the difference between the two games is likely in the `5x` range.
That seems good to me! Especially for adding a feature as fancy sounding as _Fibonacci_ to our game.
The kids will love it!

<TheEnd />

<br />

<OnFire />

<BenchPlayGameOnFireCode />

- A micro-benchmark `bench_play_game_100` for playing the game with the number one hundred (`100`)
- A micro-benchmark `bench_play_game_1_000_000` for playing the game with the number one million (`1_000_000`)

When I ran it, I got this:

<BenchPlayGameOnFireOutputStart />

Wait for it... wait for it...

<BenchPlayGameOnFireOutput />

What! `6,685 estimated cycles` x `1,000` should be `6,685,000 estimated cycles` not `155,109,206 estimated cycles` ü§Ø
Even though I got my Fibonacci sequence code functionally correct, I must have a performance bug in there somewhere.

<FizzBuzzFibonacciFixRust />

Now lets rerun those benchmarks and see how we did:

<BenchPlayGameFixOutput />

Oh, wow! Our `bench_play_game` benchmark is back down to around where it was for the original FizzBuzz.
I wish I could remember exactly what that score was. It's been three weeks though.
My terminal history doesn't go back that far.
And Iai only compares against the most recent result.
But I think it's close!

The `bench_play_game_100` benchmark is down nearly 10x, `-87.22513%`.
And the `bench_play_game_1_000_000` benchmark is down more than 10,000x! `155,109,206 estimated cycles` to `950 estimated` estimated cycles!
That's `-99.99939%`!

> üê∞ Hey, at least we caught this performance bug before it made it to production... oh, right. Nevermind...
