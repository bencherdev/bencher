## Log Normal Thresholds

A Log Normal Threshold (`log-normal`) measures how likely it is that
a new Metric is above or below the center location of your historical Metrics using a [Log Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution).

Log Normal Thresholds work best when:
- Benchmark runs are totally independent of one another
- The number of iterations for a single benchmark run is less than 10% of the historical Metrics
- All data is positive (the natural log of a negative number is `undefined`)

For Log Normal Thresholds, the likelihood expressed as a decimal percentage.
If a new Metric is below a certain left-side percentage (Lower Boundary)
or above a certain right-side percentage (Upper Boundary) for your historical Metrics an Alert is generated.
Either a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both must be set.

- ### Log Normal Threshold Lower Boundary
  - A Log Normal Threshold Lower Boundary can be any positive decimal between `0.5` and `1.0`.
Where `0.5` represents the center location and `1.0` represents all possible left-side values (-∞).
It is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you used a Log Normal Threshold with a Lower Boundary of `0.977`
and you had `25` historical Metrics centered around `100` and one pervious outlier at `200`,
the Lower Boundary Limit would be `71.20` and
any value less than `71.20` would generate an Alert.
- ### Log Normal Threshold Upper Boundary
  - A Log Normal Threshold Upper Boundary can be any positive decimal between `0.5` and `1.0`.
Where `0.5` represents the center location and `1.0` represents all possible right-side values (∞).
It is used when a greater value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you used a Log Normal Threshold with an Upper Boundary of `0.977`
and you had `25` historical Metrics centered around `100` and one previous outlier at `200`,
the Upper Boundary Limit would be `134.18` and
any value greater than `134.18` would generate an Alert.
