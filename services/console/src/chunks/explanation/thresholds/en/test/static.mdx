### Static

A Static Test (`static`) is the simplest Test.
If a new Metric is below a set Lower Boundary or above a set Upper Boundary an Alert is generated.
That is, the Lower/Upper Boundary is an explicit Lower/Upper Boundary Limit.
Either a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both must be set.
Static Tests work best when the value of the Metric should stay within a constant range across all Benchmarks,
such as code coverage.

- #### Static Lower Boundary
  - A Static Test Lower Boundary can be any floating point number.
It is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression.
The Lower Boundary must be less than or equal to the Upper Boundary, if both are specified.
  - For example, if you had a Static Test with a Lower Boundary set to `100`
the Lower Boundary Limit would likewise be `100` and
any value less than `100` would generate an Alert.
- #### Static Upper Boundary
  - A Static Test Upper Boundary can be any floating point number.
It is used when a greater value would indicate a performance regression.
The Upper Boundary must be greater than or equal to the Lower Boundary, if both are specified.
  - For example, if you had a Static Test with an Upper Boundary set to `100`
the Upper Boundary Limit would likewise be `100` and
any value greater than `100` would generate an Alert.
