> 🐰 Make sure you have [created an API token][created an api token]
> and set it as a masked variable named `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` before continuing on!
> Navigate to `Your Repo -> Settings -> CI/CD -> Variables -> Expand -> Add variable`.
> The variable key should be `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the variable value should be your API token.
