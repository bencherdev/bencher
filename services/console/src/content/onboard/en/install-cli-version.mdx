<h2>Install CLI</h2>

<h3>Linux, Mac, & Unix</h3>
For Linux, Mac, and other Unix-like systems run the following in your terminal:

```sh
export BENCHER_VERSION=0.5.6; curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://bencher.dev/download/install-cli.sh | sh
```

<h3>Windows</h3>
For Windows systems run the following in a _PowerShell_ terminal:

```powershell
$env:BENCHER_VERSION="0.5.6"; irm https://bencher.dev/download/install-cli.ps1 | iex
```

<br />

> 🐰 If you get an error that says `running scripts is disabled on this system`:
> - `Open Powershell` with `Run as Administrator`
> - Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
> - Enter: `Y`
> - Rerun this script

<h3>From Source</h3>

For all other environments, you can try to install from source. This requires you to [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/).

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/bencherdev/bencher --branch main --locked --force bencher_cli
```
