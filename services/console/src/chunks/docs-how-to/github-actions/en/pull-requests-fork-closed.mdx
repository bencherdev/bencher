import PullRequestsForkClosedCode from "../pull-requests-fork-closed-code.mdx";

To clean up the fork PR branch after its PR is closed,
you can create a separate workflow to run `on` `pull_request_target` events with the `closed` type.
This workflow will archive the fork PR branch using the `bencher archive` command.

<PullRequestsForkClosedCode />

1. Create a GitHub Actions `workflow` file.
   (ex: `.github/workflows/fork_pr_benchmarks_closed.yml`)
2. Run on `pull_request_target` events:
   - `closed` - A pull request was closed.

   See the [GitHub Actions `on` documentation][github actions on]
   and [GitHub Actions `pull_request_target` documentation][github action pull_request_target] for a full overview.
   (ex: `on: pull_request_target: types: [closed]`)
3. Create a GitHub Actions `job`.
   (ex: `jobs: archive_pr_branch`)
4. Set the type of machine the job will run on.
   See the [GitHub Actions `runs-on` documentation][github actions runs-on]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`)
5. Checkout the PR branch source code.
   (ex: `uses: actions/checkout@v6`)
6. Install the Bencher CLI using [the GitHub Action][bencher cli github action].
   (ex: `uses: bencherdev/bencher@main`)
7. Use the `bencher archive` CLI subcommand to archive the PR branch.
   (ex: `bencher archive`)
8.  Set the `--project` option to the Project slug.
    See [the `--project` docs][project option] for more details.
    (ex: `--project project-abc4567-wxyz123456789`)
9.  Set the `--token` option to the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` **Repository** secret.
    See [the `--token` docs][token option] for more details.
    (ex: `--token '${{ secrets.BENCHER_API_TOKEN }}'`)
10. Set the `--branch` option to the PR branch name
    using [the GitHub Actions `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` default environment variable][github default environment variables].
    (ex: `--branch "$GITHUB_HEAD_REF"`)
