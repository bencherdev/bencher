#### Spec
A Spec is a hardware specification that describes the resources available to a Testbed.
It includes the CPU architecture, number of CPUs, memory size, disk size, and whether the environment has network access.
Specs are server-scoped, so the same Spec can be shared across multiple Testbeds.

When a run creates a Bare Metal Job, the Spec determines
both the hardware resources and the default Testbed name:

| [`--testbed`](/docs/explanation/bencher-run/#--testbed-testbed) provided | [`--image`](/docs/explanation/bencher-run/#--image-image) provided | Testbed name source      |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| No                  | No            | Context OS               |
| Yes                 | No            | User's explicit value    |
| No                  | Yes           | Resolved Spec's name (Spec assigned to Testbed) |
| Yes                 | Yes           | User's explicit value (Spec assigned to Testbed) |
