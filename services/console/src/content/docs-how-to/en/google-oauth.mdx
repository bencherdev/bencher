If you are using Bencher Cloud, then you can simply [sign up](/auth/signup) or [log in](/auth/login)
using the `Google` button.

For Bencher Self-Hosted, you will need to have a [Bencher Plus Enterprise plan][bencher plus enterprise],
create your own Google OAuth2 client,
and update your [console server configuration][console config] and [API sever configuration][server config].

[bencher plus enterprise]: /pricing/?level=enterprise
[console config]: /docs/reference/console-config/
[server config]: /docs/reference/server-config/

> üê∞ Inactive Google OAuth clients are subject to deletion if they are not used for 6 months.
> You will be notified of deletion due to inactivity by Google and can restore clients up to 30 days after deletion.

## Google OAuth Client Configuration

### Console UI
Set the `OAUTH_GOOGLE` environment variable to `true` when you run the `bencher-console` Docker image. (ex: `OAUTH_GOOGLE=true`)
If the Client ID is missing, then the Google buttons will not appear in the UI.

### API Server
Add the `client_id` and `client_secret` to [the `plus.google` section of the server config](/docs/reference/server-config/#plusgoogle).
If the Google section is missing, then the server will fail any Google authentication requests.
