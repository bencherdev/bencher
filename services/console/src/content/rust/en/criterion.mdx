All three are [support by Bencher](/docs/explanation/adapters/). So why choose Criterion?
Criterion is the de facto standard benchmarking harness in the Rust community.
I would suggest using Criterion for benchmarking your code's latency.
That is, Criterion is great for measuring wall clock time.

<FizzBuzzRefactor />

## Benchmarking FizzBuzz

In order to benchmark our code, we need to create a `benches` directory and add file to contain our benchmarks, `play_game.rs`:

<GameBenchesTree />

Inside of `play_game.rs` add the following code:

<FizzBuzzRefactorBenchesCode />

- Import the `Criterion` benchmark runner.
- Import the `play_game` function from our `game` crate.
- Create a function named `bench_play_game` that takes in a mutable reference to `Criterion`.
- Use the `Criterion` instance (`c`) to create a benchmark named `bench_play_game`.
- Then use the benchmark runner (`b`) to run our macro-benchmark several times.
- Run our macro-benchmark inside of a "black box" so the compiler doesn't optimize our code.
- Iterate from `1` to `100` inclusively.
- For each number, call `play_game`, with `print` set to `false`.

Now we need to configure the `game` crate to run our benchmarks.

Add the following to the _bottom_ of your `Cargo.toml` file:

<GameCargoToml />

- `criterion`: Add `criterion` as a development dependency, since we are only using it for performance testing.
- `bench`: Register `play_game` as a benchmark and set `harness` to `false`, since we will be using Criterion as our benchmarking harness.

Now we're ready to benchmark our code, run `cargo bench`:

<BenchPlayGameOutput />

> 🐰 Lettuce turnip the beet! We've got our first benchmark metrics!

Finally, we can rest our weary developer heads...
Just kidding, our users want a new feature!

<FizzBuzzFibonacciRust>
  <PlayGameRustCode />
</FizzBuzzFibonacciRust>

## Benchmarking FizzBuzzFibonacci

Now we can rerun our benchmark:

<BenchPlayGameFibonacciOutput />

Oh, neat! Criterion tells us the difference between the performance of our FizzBuzz and FizzBuzzFibonacci games is `+568.69%`.
Your numbers will be a little different than mine.
However, the difference between the two games is likely in the `5x` range.
That seems good to me! Especially for adding a feature as fancy sounding as _Fibonacci_ to our game.
The kids will love it!

<OnFire />

<BenchPlayGameOnFireCode />

- A micro-benchmark `bench_play_game_100` for playing the game with the number one hundred (`100`)
- A micro-benchmark `bench_play_game_1_000_000` for playing the game with the number one million (`1_000_000`)

When I ran it, I got this:

<BenchPlayGameOnFireOutputStart />

Wait for it... wait for it...

<BenchPlayGameOnFireOutput />

What! `403.57 ns` x `1,000` should be `403,570 ns` not `9,596,800 ns` (`9.5968 ms` x `1_000_000 ns/1 ms`) 🤯
Even though I got my Fibonacci sequence code functionally correct, I must have a performance bug in there somewhere.

<FizzBuzzFibonacciFixRust />

Now lets rerun those benchmarks and see how we did:

<BenchPlayGameFixOutput />

Oh, wow! Our `bench_play_game` benchmark is back down to around where it was for the original FizzBuzz.
I wish I could remember exactly what that score was. It's been three weeks though.
My terminal history doesn't go back that far.
And Criterion only compares against the most recent result.
But I think it's close!

The `bench_play_game_100` benchmark is down nearly 10x, `-93.950%`.
And the `bench_play_game_1_000_000` benchmark is down more than 10,000x! `9,596,800 ns` to `30.403 ns`!
We even maxed out Criterion's change meter, which only goes up to `-100.000%`!

> 🐰 Hey, at least we caught this performance bug before it made it to production... oh, right. Nevermind...
