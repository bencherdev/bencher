## Benchmark Command

The first argument to `bencher run` is the optional benchmark command.
This is the command that will be executed, invoking your benchmark harness.
It can also be set using the `BENCHER_CMD` environment variable.
By default this command is executed in a shell,
which can be configured with the [`--shell`][shell option] and [`--flag`][flag option] options.
Its output is parsed by a [benchmark harness adapter][benchmark harness adapters],
which can be set using the [`--adapter`][adapter option] option.
However, if the benchmark harness outputs to a file then the [`--file`][file option] option
must also be used to specify the output file path.
Alternatively to track the size of the output file (ie binary size) instead of its contents,
use the [`--file-size`][file size option] option to specify the output file path.

If you would prefer to not have the command executed in a shell, you can use the `--exec` flag or simply provide additional arguments to your command as additional arguments to `bencher run`.

Shell Form:
```bash
bencher run "bencher mock"
```

Exec Form:
```bash
bencher run bencher mock
```

The benchmark command can be run multiple times using the [`--iter`][iter option] option,
and those results can be folded into a single result using the [`--fold`][fold option] option.
If any of the iterations fail, then the entire command is considered to have failed
unless the [`--allow-failure`][allow failure flag] flag is set.

If the benchmark command is not specified but the [`--file`][file option] option is,
then `bencher run` will just read from output file path instead.
Similarly, if the the benchmark command is not specified but the [`--file-size`][file size option] option is,
then `bencher run` will just read the size of the file at the given file path instead.
If neither the benchmark command, [`--file`][file option] option,
nor [`--file-size`][file size option] option are specified,
then `bencher run` will read from `stdin` instead.
This allows you to save the output of another command to a file or pipe it into `bencher run`.
