import FileCmdExample from "../file-cmd-example.mdx";
import FileNoCmdExample from "../file-no-cmd-example.mdx";

If your results were instead stored in a file named `results.json`,
then you could use the `--file` option to specify the file path.
This works both with [a benchmark command][bencher run] and without one.

With a command:
<FileCmdExample />

Without a command:
<FileNoCmdExample />
