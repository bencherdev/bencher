### Create a Custom Benchmark Runner

Finally, we need to create a runner for our custom benchmark harness.
A custom benchmark harness is really just a binary
that runs all of our benchmarks for us and reports its results.
The benchmark runner is what orchestrates all of that.

We want our results to be output in [Bencher Metric Format (BMF) JSON][bmf json].
To accomplish this, we need to add one final dependency,
[the `serde_json` crate][crates serde json] by... you guessed it, David Tolnay!

<CargoTomlSerdeJson />

Next, we will implement a method for `CustomBenchmark` to run its benchmark function
and then return the results as BMF JSON.

<PlayGameRsRun />

The BMF JSON results contain six [Measures][measures] for each benchmark:

- Final Blocks: Final number of blocks allocated when the benchmark finished.
- Final Bytes: Final number of bytes allocated when the benchmark finished.
- Max Blocks: Maximum number of blocks allocated at one time during the benchmark run.
- Max Bytes: Maximum number of bytes allocated at one time during the benchmark run.
- Total Blocks: Total number of blocks allocated during the benchmark run.
- Total Bytes: Total number of bytes allocated during the benchmark run.

Finally, we can create a `main` function to run all of the benchmarks in our `inventory` collection
and output the results as BMF JSON.
