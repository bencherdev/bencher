The easiest way to deploy [Bencher Self-Hosted][bencher self hosted] is using a triptych of `bencher` CLI subcommands:

- [`bencher up`][bencher up]: Bring up the Bencher Self-Hosted containers.
  This is similar to running [`docker compose up`][docker compose up].
- [`bencher logs`][bencher logs]: View output from the Bencher Self-Hosted containers,
  if `bencher up` was run with [the `--detach` flag][detach flag].
  This is similar to running [`docker compose logs`][docker compose logs].
- [`bencher down`][bencher down]: Stop and remove the Bencher Self-Hosted containers,
  if `bencher up` was run with [the `--detach` flag][detach flag].
  This is similar to running [`docker compose down`][docker compose down].
