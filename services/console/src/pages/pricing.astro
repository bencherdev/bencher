                  Bencher Bare Metal delivers bare metal continuous benchmarking servers as a service (CBaaS).
                  These servers are tuned by performance experts to eliminate noise and get wall-clock time variance to less than 1%!
                  Take your performance engineering to the next level
                  and start catching even subtler performance regressions in CI.

            <p>A Metric is a single, point-in-time benchmark result.</p>
            <p>
              For example, if you have five benchmarks then they would create
              five Metrics each time they run. If you ran your benchmarks ten
              times, you would then have fifty Metrics. (ex: 5 benchmarks x 10
              runs = 50 Metrics)

            </h3>
            <p>
              On Bencher Cloud Metrics are billed either:
              <ul>
                <li>Monthly based on metered usage</li>
                <li>Annually based on a licensed quantity</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if you create 5,280 Metrics in a particular calendar
              month with metered usage then you would be billed for 5,280 Metrics that month.
            </p>
            <p>
							Bencher Self-Hosted Metrics are always billed annually based on a licensed quantity.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, if you create 5,280 Metrics within a given year,
              then you would need to have a licensed quantity of say 6,000 Metrics.

              Yes, if you have a valid Bencher Plus plan then Metrics from both

            <p>
              The <a href="/legal/license/">Bencher License</a> is heavily inspired by the

              You can use Bencher Self-Hosted in development, testing, and production without a Bencher Plus license.
              This is equivalent to using Bencher Cloud on the Free plan.
              If you would like access to any of the Bencher Plus features (Team or Enterprise),
              then you will need to purchase a Bencher Plus license.

          Bencher is a for profit company that balances the need to improve the

            <li>
              When a feature is open source we won't move that feature to a paid
              tier. Features might be removed from the open source codebase in
              other cases, for example when combining features from multiple
              tiers into one new feature. To be clear, this promise only applies
              to open sourced features, features in paid tiers might move to a
              higher tier.
            </li>
            <li>
              We won't introduce features into the open source codebase with a
              fixed delay, if a feature is planned to land in both it will be
              released simultaneously in both.
            </li>
            <li>
              We will always release and open source all tests that we have for
              an open source feature.

            <li>
              The open source codebase will have all the essential features for
              tracking the performance of a large open source project.

            <li>
              The open source codebase will not contain any artificial limits

            Our stewardship promise applies only to the Bencher open source

            we may add limits around usage (e.g., storage, compute, traffic) or
            proxies for usage (e.g., number of users in a project) as we seek to
            optimize costs and revenues.
