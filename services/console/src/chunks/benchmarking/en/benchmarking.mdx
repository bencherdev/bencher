## What is Benchmarking?

Benchmarking is the practice of testing the performance of your code
to see how fast (latency) or how much (throughput) work it can do.
This often overlooked step in software development is crucial
for creating and maintaining fast and performant code.
Benchmarking provides the necessary metrics for developers to understand
how well their code performs under various workloads and conditions.
For the same reasons that you write unit and integration tests to prevent feature regressions,
you should write benchmarks to prevent performance regressions.
Performance bugs are bugs!
