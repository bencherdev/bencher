`bencher run` is the most popular CLI subcommand.
It is used to run benchmarks and report the results.
As such, it is one of the most complicated subcommands.
This page will explain the options, flags, and arguments that can be passed to `bencher run`.

## Benchmark Command:

The first and only argument to `bencher run` is the optional benchmark command.
This is the command that will be executed, invoking your benchmark harness.
The command is executed in a shell, which can be configured with the `--shell` and `--flag` options.
Its output is parsed by a benchmark harness adapter, which can be set using the `--adapter` option.
However, if the benchmark harness outputs to a file then the `--file` option must also be used to specify the output file path.

<br />

> 🐰 If your benchmark command is multiple words, then you must wrap it in quotes (ie `bencher run "bencher mock"`).

<br />

The benchmark command can be run multiple times using the `--iter` option,
and those results can be folded into a single result using the `--fold` option.
If any of the iterations fail, then the entire command is considered to have failed unless the `--allow-failure` flag is set.

If the benchmark command is not specified, then `bencher run` will read from `stdin` instead.
This allows you to pipe the output of another command into `bencher run`.

## Options:

### `--project <PROJECT>`

<br />

Either the `--project` option or the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable
must be set to the slug or UUID of an already existing project.
If both are defined, the `--project` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environement variable.

<br />

### `--token <TOKEN>`

<br />

Either the `--token` option or the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` environment variable must be set to a valid API token.
If both are defined, the `--token` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` environement variable.

<br />

### `--branch <BRANCH>`
### `--if-branch <IF_BRANCH>`
### `--else-if-branch <ELSE_IF_BRANCH>`
### `--else-branch`
### `--endif-branch`

<br />

See [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection) for a full overview.

<br />

### `--hash <HASH>`

<br />

Optional: A 40-character SHA-1 commit hash.
If two reports have the same branch and hash, they will be considered to be from the same commit.
Therefore, they will have the same branch version number.

<br />

### `--testbed <TESTBED>`

<br />

Optional: Either the `--testbed` option or the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environment variable
may be set to the slug or UUID of an already existing testbed.
If both are defined, the `--testbed` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environement variable.
If neither are defined then `localhost` is used as the default testbed.

<br />

### `--adapter <ADAPTER>`
### `--average <AVERAGE>`
### `--file <FILE>`

<br />

See [benchmark harness adapter](/docs/explanation/adapters) for a full overview.

<br />

### `--iter <ITER>`

<br />

Optional: Number of run iterations. The default is `1`.

### `--fold <FOLD>`

<br />

Optional: Fold multiple results into a single result. \
Requires: `--iter` to be set. \
Possible values:
    - `min`:    Minimum value
    - `max`:    Maximum value
    - `mean`:   Mean of values
    - `median`: Median of values

<br />

### `--allow-failure`

<br />

Optional: Allow benchmark test failure.

<br />

### `--err`

<br />

Optional: Error when an alert is generated. See [thresholds and alerts](/docs/explanation/thresholds) for a full overview.

<br />

### `--shell <SHELL>`

<br />

Optional: Shell command path. Defaults to `/bin/sh` on Unix-like environements and `cmd` on Windows.

<br />

### `--flag <FLAG>`

<br />

Optional: Shell command flag. Defaults to `-c` on Unix-like environements and `/C` on Windows.

<br />

### `--host <HOST>`

<br />

Optional: Backend host URL. Defaults to [https://api.bencher.dev](https://api.bencher.dev).

<br />

### `--attempts <ATTEMPTS>`

<br />

Optional: Max request retry attempts. Defaults to `10`.

<br />


### `--retry-after <RETRY_AFTER>`

<br />

Optional: Retry request after the given number of seconds. Defaults to `3`.

<br />

### `-h`
### `--help`

<br />

Optional: Print help.
