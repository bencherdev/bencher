### `--project <PROJECT>`

<br />

Optional: Either the `--project` option or the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable
may be set to the slug or UUID for a Project.
If the value specified is a slug and the Project does not already exist, it will be created for you.
However, if the value specified is a UUID then the Project must already exist.
If both are specified, the `--project` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable.
If neither are specified then a Project slug will be generated for you based on:

1. The name of the parent directory for the `git` repository, if it is available.
2. The 7 digit hexadecimal short hash for the initial commit of the `git` repository, if it is available.
3. A 13 digit alphanumeric fingerprint of the local machine, for supported operating systems.

For example, a generated Project slug might look like: `project-abc4567-wxyz123456789`

When a new Project is created for you, whether the slug is specified or generated,
the Project has to belong to an Organization.
If the user is authenticated, then the Project is added under that user's personal Organization.
If the user is not authenticated, the Project will be created under a new `unclaimed` Organization.
This Organization can then be `claimed` from the Project's public Perf Page
or by using the Project slug while authenticated in a subsequent invocation of `bencher run`.

> 🐰 IMPORTANT: If the `CI` environment variable is set to `true`,
> then you either need to specify the Project
> or set [the `--ci-on-the-fly` flag][ci on the fly].
