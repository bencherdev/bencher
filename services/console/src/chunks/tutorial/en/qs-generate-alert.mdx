## Generate an Alert

Now that we have some historical data for our benchmarks, lets generate an Alert!
Alerts are generated when a benchmark result is determined to be a performance regression.
So lets simulate a performance regression!

Run: `bencher run "bencher mock --pow 8"`

<br />

There should be a new section at the end of the output called `View alerts`:

<QuickStart11 />

<br />

You can now view the Alerts for each benchmark in the browser.
Click or copy and paste the links from `View alerts`.
