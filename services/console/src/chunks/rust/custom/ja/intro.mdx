With all that in mind, if you are looking to benchmark your code's wall clock time then you should probably use Criterion. If you are looking to [benchmark your code in CI][continuous benchmarking] with shared runners then it may be worth checking out Iai. Note though, Iai hasn't been update [in over 3 years][github iai]. So you might consider [using Iai-Callgrind][adapters iai callgrind] instead.

But what if you don't want to benchmark wall clock time or instruction counts? What if you want to track some completely different benchmark‽ Luckily, Rust makes it incredibly easy to create a custom benchmarking harness.
