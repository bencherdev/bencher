If you had a script located at `./my_build_script.sh` that built your binary
at the path `./path/to/my_binary`,
then you could track the size of this binary file with
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
and [the `json` adapter][json adapter].
This would work both with [a benchmark command][bencher run] and without one.

With a benchmark command:
<CmdExample />

Without a benchmark command:
<NoCmdExample />

In either case, the generated BMF JSON would look like this,
if `my_binary` had a size of `42` bytes:

<JsonExample />

In this example, the key `my_binary` is the binary file name.
It is used as the name of the [Benchmark][benchmark].
The `my_binary` object contains the `file-size` key.
`file-size` is the slug for the built-in File Size [Measure][measure].
The File Size Measure is not created by default for all Projects.
However, when you use the File Size Measure,
it will be automatically created for your Project.
The File Size Measure object contains a [Metric][metric]
with the file size `value` in bytes, `42.0`.
