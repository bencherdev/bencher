### Measure
A Measure is the unit of measurement for a Metric.
By default all Projects start with a `Latency` and `Throughput` Measure
with units of `nanoseconds (ns)` and `operations / second (ops/s)` respectively.
The Measure is determined by the [benchmark harness adapter][adapters].

If you are using [Bencher Metric Format (BMF)][bmf] the name, slug, or UUID can be used to identify a Measure.
