# SQLite Expert

SQLite has an experimental "expert" mode that can be enabled with [the `.expert on` command][expert on].
It suggests indexes for queries, so I decided to give it a try.
This is what it suggested:

<SqliteExpertOutput />

This is definitely an improvement!
It got rid of the scan on the `metric` table and both of the on-the-fly indexes.
Honestly, I wouldn't have gotten the first two indexes on my own.
Thank you, SQLite Expert!

<SqliteIndexes />

Now the only thing left to get rid of was that darn `SCAN boundary`.
