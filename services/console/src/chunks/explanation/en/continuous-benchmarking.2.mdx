## Continuous Benchmarking vs Local Benchmark Comparison

There are several benchmark harnesses that allow you to compare results locally.
Local comparison is great for iterating quickly when performance tuning.
However, it should not be relied on to catch performance regressions on an ongoing basis.
Just as being able to run unit tests locally doesn't obviate the need for CI,
being able to run and compare benchmarks locally doesn't obviate the need for CB.

There are several features Bencher offers that local benchmark comparison tools cannot:
- Comparison of the same benchmark between different testbeds
- Comparison of benchmarks across languages and harnesses
- Collaboration and sharing of benchmark results
- Running benchmarks on dedicated testbeds to minimize noise
- No more copypasta

## Continuous Benchmarking vs Application Performance Management (APM)

Application Performance Management (APM) is a vital tool for modern software services.
However, APM is designed to be used in production.
By the time a performance regression is detected, it is already impacting your customers.

> Most defects end up costing more than it would have cost to prevent them.
> Defects are expensive when they occur, both the direct costs of fixing the defects
> and the indirect costs because of damaged relationships, lost business, and lost development time.

There are several features Bencher offers that APM tools cannot:
- Detect and prevent performance regressions _before_ they make it to production
- Performance changes and impacts included in code review
- No overhead in production environments
- Effective for on-prem deployments
- No changes to production source code

## Continuous Benchmarking vs Observability

A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
See Continuous Benchmarking vs Application Performance Management above.

## Continuous Benchmarking vs Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Benchmarking (CB) is complimentary to Continuous Integration (CI).
For the same reasons that unit tests are run in CI for each code change,
performance tests should be run in CB for each code change.

> While unit and acceptance testing are widely embraced as standard development practices,
> this trend has not continued into the realm of performance testing.
> Currently, the common tooling drives testers towards creating throw away code and a click-and-script mentality.
> Treating performance testing as a first-class citizen enables the creation of better tests that cover more functionality,
> leading to better tooling to create and run performance tests,
> resulting in a test suite that is maintainable and can itself be tested.

## Continuous Benchmarking vs Continuous Load Testing

In order to understand the difference between Continuous Benchmarking and Continuous Load Testing,
you need to understand the difference between
[benchmarking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)) and
[load testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_load_testing).

|  Test Kind   |     Test Scope     | Test Users |
| :----------: | :----------------: | :--------: |
| Benchmarking | Function - Service | One - Many |
| Load Testing |      Service       |    Many    |

Benchmarking can test the performance of software from the function level (micro-benchmarks) all the way up to the service level (macro-benchmarks).
Benchmarks are great for testing the performance of a particular part of your code in an isolated manner.
Load testing only tests the performance of software at the service level and mocks multiple concurrent users.
Load tests are great for testing the performance of the entire service under a specific load.

🍦 Imagine we wanted to track the performance of an ice-cream truck.
Benchmarking could be used to measure how long it takes to scoop an ice-cream cone (micro-benchmark), and
benchmarking could also be used to measure how long it takes a single customer to order, get their ice-cream, and pay (macro-benchmark).
Load testing could be used to see how well the ice-cream truck serves 100 customer on a hot summer day.
