## Interquartile Range Thresholds

An Interquartile Range Threshold (`iqr`) measures how many multiples of the [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) (IQR)
a new Metric is above or below the median of your historical Metrics.
If a new Metric is below a certain multiple of the IQR from the median (Lower Boundary)
or above a certain multiple of the IQR from the median (Upper Boundary) of your historical Metrics an Alert is generated.
Either a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both must be set.

- ### Interquartile Range Threshold Lower Boundary
  - An Interquartile Range Threshold Lower Boundary can be any multiplier greater than or equal to zero (ex: use `2.0` for `2x`).
It is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you had an Interquartile Range Threshold with a Lower Boundary set to `2.0`
and your historical Metrics had a median of `100` and an interquartile range of `10`
the Lower Boundary Limit would be `80` and
any value less than `80` would generate an Alert.
- ### Interquartile Range Threshold Upper Boundary
  - An Interquartile Range Threshold Upper Boundary can be any multiplier greater than or equal to zero (ex: use `2.0` for `2x`).
It is used when a greater value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you had an Interquartile Range Threshold with an Upper Boundary set to `2.0`
and your historical Metrics had a median of `100` and an interquartile range of `10`
the Upper Boundary Limit would be `120` and
any value greater than `120` would generate an Alert.
