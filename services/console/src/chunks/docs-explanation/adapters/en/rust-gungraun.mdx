## ðŸ¦€ Rust Gungraun

The Rust Gungraun Adapter (`rust_gungraun`) expects [Gungraun](https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun) output.
The `instructions`, `l1-hits`, `l2-hits`, `ram-hits`, `total-read-write`, and `estimated-cycles` Measures are gathered by default.
Additional Callgrind, Cachegrind, and DHAT metrics that Gungraun can produce are also supported.
Only the reported value (ie `value`) is available is available for these Measures.
Neither `lower_value` nor `upper_value` are collected.
The Measures for this adapter are not created by default for all projects.
However, when you use this adapter, these Measures will be automatically created for your Project.

Gungraun is the renamed successor to Iai-Callgrind.
