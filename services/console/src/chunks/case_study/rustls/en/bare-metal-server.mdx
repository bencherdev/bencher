#### Bare Metal Server
In order to get a 1% resolution on their wall-time benchmarks,
the Rustls project invested in a [specially configured][server config],
bare metal continuous benchmarking server.
Unlike most modern CI runners, this server is _not_ ephemeral.
That is, the same underlying server hardware and operating system are used for each run.
There is no virtualization.

The bare metal server has been specifically configured to create the most consistent results possible.
Frequency scaling (Intel's TurboBoost)
and simultaneous multithreading (Intel's Hyper-Threading) have both been disabled in the BIOS.
CPU scaling is set to `performance`.
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and the Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) watchdog
are both disabled by setting `kernel.randomize_va_space=0` and `kernel.nmi_watchdog=0`
in `sysctl.conf`, respectively.
The bare metal server is hosted by [OHVcloud][OVHcloud].
