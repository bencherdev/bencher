### `--image <IMAGE>`

<br />

➕ Bencher Plus: Set the OCI image reference for remote [Bare Metal Runner][spec] execution
(e.g. `my-image:tag`, `registry.bencher.dev/my-image:tag`,
or for Bencher Self-Hosted instances `localhost:61016/my-image:tag`).
Only the OCI registry for the Bencher API server is supported.
When `--image` is set, the benchmark command runs on a remote Bare Metal Runner
instead of locally.
