        carefully before using the Services or submitting any information to us.

      <h3>Information Collection</h3>
      <h5>Usage and Log Information</h5>
      <p>
        We collect usage information when you use the Services. This includes
        information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address,
        operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website or
        a website to which you exit, the date and time you access or use the
        Services, items you click on, pages you view, and the amount of time you
        spend on particular pages.
      </p>
      <h5>Cookies and Online advertising</h5>
      <p>
        We also collect certain information (automatically) through the use of
        "cookies" and similar tracking technologies. Cookies are small data
        files that are stored on a user's computer or device at the request of a
        website to enable the website to recognize previous visitors and retain
        information such as user preferences and history. If you wish to block,
        erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser
        instructions or "help screen" to learn about these functions. However,
        if your browser is set to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie,
        you will not be able to sign in to your Bencher account or use certain
        parts of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also use third parties to display and target ads, provide certain
        functionality (such as maps), or to place their own cookies and other
        tracking technologies to collect, track and analyze usage and
        statistical information from users. We are not responsible for the
        information collection practices of any third parties.
      </p>
      <h5>Personal Information</h5>
      <p>
        We collect and store Personal Information that you provide to us when
        accessing or using the Services. "Personal Information" means
        information relating to a person who is or can be identified directly
        from that information. This includes your name, address, telephone
        number, email address, credit card, or other account number. Personal
        Information does not include: (1) aggregated or anonymized information
        (2) any publicly available information about legal products or legal
        services (3) information about you that is provided by third parties (4)
        information that is posted to publicly accessible areas of the Services.
        Examples of Personal Information we collect include information that you
        provide when you: (a) create or update your Bencher account (b)
        communicate with us (c) purchase services from us (d) contact or
        recommend a legal resource or legal service (e) submit referrals. If you
        are a Partner and claim or update your listings ("Listings"), or post
        information using your Listings, we may also collect verification
        information.
      </p>
      <h5>Publicly Posted Information</h5>
      <p>
        Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Services or
        via your Listings may become publicly available and is no longer
        considered Personal Information. For example, information you post in
        your Listings or any other interactive areas may be made publicly
        available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such
        public areas of the Services constitutes consent to share such
        information publicly, and you should assume that such information will
        be widely disseminated, including via search engines and other tools to
        locate information online (e.g., Internet Archive).
      </p>
      <h3>Using Information Collected</h3>
      <h5>Non-Personal Information</h5>
      <p>
        We use information other than Personal Information, including aggregated
        or anonymized information, for remarketing with Google Analytics, for ad
        targeting, to analyze trends, administer the Services, improve customer
        service, diagnose problems with our servers, track user movement, and
        gather demographic information for aggregate use. Third-party ad
        platforms may use this information for a similar purpose, but you should
        follow up with third parties and confirm their information collection
        and usage practices directly. We may freely publish, disclose, and use
        information other than Personal Information, including aggregated or
        anonymized Personal Information, to or with third parties.
      </p>
      <h5>Personal Information</h5>
      <p>
        We use Personal Information to facilitate your use of the Services, to
        process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information,
        products, and services you request, to administer and assist us with the
        operation of our business, and for the purpose for which the information
        was provided. We may use the information we collect to send you news
        relevant to you or in accordance with your preferences. We may also send
        you advertisements from third parties. We do not disclose, rent, sell,
        or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties
        for direct marketing purposes.
      </p>
      <h5>Third Party Service Providers</h5>
      <p>
        In the event that we engage with third-party service providers in
        connection with our Services, we may share Personal Information with
        such service providers who need access to such information to carry out
        their work for us. For example, we may use credit card processing or
        verification companies to verify credit card information or to verify
        your identity. Other than such service providers, we do not share
        Personal Information with third parties unless (1) you have indicated to
        us that you wish to receive information from such parties (2) you
        otherwise give us your consent to do so (3) in response to a request for
        information or a subpoena.
      </p>
      <h5>Text Messaging</h5>
      <p>
        We do not ordinarily send text messages for marketing purposes, but to
        the extent you provide us with your mobile telephone number, you consent
        to the transmission of text messages to such number, and waive any
        rights you may have under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. You
        may, however, <a href="mailto:info@bencher.dev">contact us</a> and
        opt-out of receiving such texts.
      </p>
      <h3>Managing Communications Preferences</h3>
      <p>
        You may select whether or not you wish to continue to receive
        newsletters or other communications by{" "}
        <a href="mailto:info@bencher.dev">contacting us</a>. In addition, you
        may "opt-out" of receiving any category of subscription, marketing, or
        promotional email from Bencher by following the unsubscribe instructions
        or using the unsubscribe as within the emails we send. Please note,
        however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt-out"
        of receiving service or account-related emails from Bencher.
      </p>
      <h3>Requests for Information</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose Personal Information when we are required to or we
        believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful
        subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or
        our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect
        for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights, property or
        safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use
        of the Services; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger
        of death or serious physical injury to any person requires or justifies
        disclosure of Personal Information.
      </p>
      <h3>Security Measures</h3>
      <p>
        Bencher endeavors to secure your Personal Information from unauthorized
        access, use or disclosure by putting into place reasonable physical,
        electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we
        collect. No security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect
        the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your
        password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are
        responsible for all use of the Services by any person using your
        password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us if you believe
        your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not
        secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive
        information to us via an unsecured email.
      </p>
      <h3>Third Party Websites</h3>
      <p>
        The Services may contain as to other websites or make available
        third-party services, including ad platforms and technologies. We are
        not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We
        encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy policies of any
        website or service that collects your information. Similarly, if you
        accessed the Services through another website, we are not responsible
        for the privacy practices of that website, and you should review the
        privacy policy of the originating website before providing any
        information to that website. This Policy applies solely to information
        collected by us.

      <h3>Transfers of Information</h3>
      <p>
        Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be
        disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of
        company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or
        receivership in which Personal Information could be transferred to third
        parties as one of Bencher's business assets. In such an event, we will
        attempt to notify you before your Personal Information is transferred,
        but you may not have the right to opt-out of any such transfer.
      </p>
