### Refactor FizzBuzz

In order to test our FizzBuzz application, we need to decouple our logic from program's `main` function.
Benchmark harnesses can't benchmark the `main` function.

Update your code to look like this:

<FizzBuzzRefactorRustCode />

We have now separated our code out into three different functions:

- `main`: Then main entrypoint into our program that iterates through the numbers `1` to `100` inclusive and calls `play_game` for each number.
- `play_game`: Takes in an unsigned integer `n`, calls `fizz_buzz` with that number, and prints the result.
- `fizz_buzz`: Takes in an unsigned integer `n` and performs the actual `Fizz`, `Buzz`, `FizzBuzz`, or number logic returning the result as a string.
