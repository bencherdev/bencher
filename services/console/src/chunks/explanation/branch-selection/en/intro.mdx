A Branch is the `git` ref (ie branch name or tag).
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
select a Branch with the `--branch` option or the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable.
By default all projects start with a `main` Branch, and
`main` is used by default if neither are specified.

When [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking], that is benchmarking in CI,
you will often want to create or rebase a `branch` on an already existing Branch.
This is called a Branch [Start Point][start point].
A Start Point is another Branch at a specific version (and `git` hash, if available).
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
select a Start Point with the `--branch-start-point` option.
Additionally, use the `--branch-start-point-hash` option to specify a specific `git` hash for the Start Point.
All the data and [Thresholds][thresholds] are copied over from the Start Point.
