The Bencher Console UI does not require any configuration.
However, some defaults can be customized to suite your needs
using the following environment variables:

- `BENCHER_API_URL`: The URL for [the Bencher API server][server config].
  By default, this is set to `http://localhost:61016`.
- `INTERNAL_API_URL`: When using Docker based networking, such as with `docker compose`,
  this is needed for Docker-to-Docker communication when using a local `BENCHER_API_URL`.
  Do not set this when using a remote `BENCHER_API_URL`, such as `https://bencher.example.com`.
  By default, this is not set.
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: The GitHub Client ID for a [Self-Hosted GitHub App][github app] to enable "Login with GitHub".
  This requires a [Bencher Plus Enterprise plan][bencher plus enterprise]. By default, this is not set.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: The Google Client ID for a [Self-Hosted Google OAuth2][google oauth2] to enable "Login with Google".
  This requires a [Bencher Plus Enterprise plan][bencher plus enterprise]. By default, this is not set.
