## Run a Report

We are finally ready to collect some benchmark metrics!
For simplicity's sake, we will be using mock data in this tutorial.

Run: `bencher mock`

You should see something like:

<QSMockOutput />

Your output should be slightly different than the above, as the data are pseudorandom.
It's just important that this command works.

<br />

Now lets run a report using mock benchmark metric data.
Substitute your Project `slug` for the `--project` argument (ie `YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG`) in the command below.

Run: `bencher run --project YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG "bencher mock"`

You should see something like:

<QSRunOutput />

<br />

You can now view the results from each of the benchmarks in the browser.
Click or copy and paste the links from `View results`.
There should only be a single data point for each benchmark, so lets add some more data!

<br />

First, lets set our Project slug as an environment variable, so we don't have to provide it with the `--project` on every single run.

Run: `export BENCHER_PROJECT=save-walter-white-1234abcd`

If you then run: `echo $BENCHER_PROJECT`

You should see:

<QSExportProjectOutput />

<br />

Lets rerun the same command again without `--project` to generate more data.

Run: `bencher run "bencher mock"`

<br />

Now, lets generate more data, but this time we will pipe our results into `bencher run`.

Run: `bencher mock | bencher run`

<br />

Sometimes you may want to save your results to a file and have `bencher run` pick them up.

Run: `bencher run --file results.json "bencher mock > results.json"`

<br />

Likewise, you may have a separate process run your benchmarks and save your results to a file. Then `bencher run` will just pick them up.

Run: `bencher mock > results.json && bencher run --file results.json`

<br />

Finally, lets seed a lot of data using the `bencher run` `--iter` argument.

Run: `bencher run --iter 16 "bencher mock"`

<br />
