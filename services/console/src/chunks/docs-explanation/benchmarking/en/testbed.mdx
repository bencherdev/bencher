### Testbed
A Testbed is the name of the testing environment used when running a Report.
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
`Linux`, `macOS`, or `Windows` is used as the default Testbed based on the host operating system.
If the `bencher` CLI has been compiled for a different operating system,
then `localhost` is used.

A Testbed can optionally have a Spec assigned to it.
A Spec describes the hardware that the Testbed runs on.
When a Report is created, the Testbed's current Spec at that point in time is recorded with the Report.
This allows you to track how benchmark results relate to the underlying hardware,
even if the Testbed's Spec changes over time.
