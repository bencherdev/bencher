### `--github-actions <GITHUB_TOKEN>`

<br />

Optional: Set the GitHub API authentication token (ie `--github-actions ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`).
When this option is set and `bencher run` is used in GitHub Actions as a part of a pull request,
then the results will be added to the pull request as a comment.
The most convenient way to do this is the [GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

> 🐰 If you are running inside of a Docker container within GitHub Action, you will need to pass in the following environment variables and mount the path specified by `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`:
> - `GITHUB_ACTIONS`
> - `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`
> - `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`

<br />

### `--ci-only-thresholds`

<br />

Optional: Only post results to CI if [a Threshold exists](/docs/explanation/thresholds/) for the Branch, Testbed, and Measure.
If no Thresholds exist, then nothing will be posted.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br />

### `--ci-only-on-alert`

<br />

Optional: Only start posting results to CI if [an Alert is generated](/docs/explanation/thresholds/#alerts).
If an Alert is generated, then all follow up results will also be posted even if they don't contain any Alerts.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br />

### `--ci-id <ID>`

<br />

Optional: Custom ID for posting results to CI.
By default, Bencher will automatically segment out results by the combination of: Project, Branch, Testbed, and [Adapter](/docs/explanation/adapters/).
Setting a custom ID is useful when Bencher is being run multiple times in the same CI workflow for the same Project, Branch, Testbed, and Adapter combination.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br/>

### `--ci-number <NUMBER>`

<br />

Optional: Issue number for posting results to CI.
Bencher will try its best to detect the CI issue number needed to post results.
However, this isn't always available in complex setups, like using `workflow_run` in GitHub Actions.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br/>

### `--shell <SHELL>`

<br />

Optional: Shell command path.
Defaults to `/bin/sh` on Unix-like environments and `cmd` on Windows.

<br />

### `--flag <FLAG>`

<br />

Optional: Shell command flag.
Defaults to `-c` on Unix-like environments and `/C` on Windows.

<br />

<Exec />

<br />

### `--host <URL>`

<br />

Optional: Backend host URL.
Defaults to Bench Cloud: [https://api.bencher.dev](https://api.bencher.dev)

<br />

### `--attempts <ATTEMPTS>`

<br />

Optional: Max request retry attempts.
Defaults to `10` attempts.

<br />


### `--retry-after <RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS>`

<br />

Optional: Initial seconds to wait between attempts (exponential backoff).
Defaults to `1` second.

<br />


### `--dry-run`

<br />

Optional: Perform a dry run. This will not store any data to the backend.
Neither a Report, Branch (as detailed in [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection/)), nor Testbed will be created.

<br />

### `-h`
### `--help`

<br />

Optional: Print help.
