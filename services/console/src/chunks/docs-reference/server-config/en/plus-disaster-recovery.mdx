### `plus.disaster_recovery`

This section specifies the disaster recovery configuration.
Bencher supports continuously replicating all database changes.
For running on demand or scheduled backups, see the `database.data_store` section of the configuration.

There are five replication `scheme`s:
- `file`: Replicate to a local file path
    - `path`: Path to replicate to
- `sftp`: Replicate over SFTP
    - `host`: Target system hostname
    - `port`: Target system port number
    - `user`: Username on target system
    - `password`: (Optional) Password on target system
    - `path`: (Optional) Path on target system
    - `key_path`: (Optional) Path to SSH key
- `s3`: Replicate to any S3 compatible blob storage
    - `bucket`: Bucket name
    - `path`: (Optional) Path in bucket
    - `endpoint`: (AWS: Optional | Non-AWS: Required) Replication endpoint
    - `region`: (Optional) Bucket region
    - `access_key_id`: S3 access key
    - `secret_access_key`: S3 secret access key
- `abs`: Replicate to Azure Blob Storage
    - `account_name`: Account name
    - `bucket`: Bucket name
    - `path`: (Optional) Path in bucket
    - `account_key`: Azure account key
- `gcs`: Replicate to Google Cloud Storage
    - `bucket`: Bucket name
    - `path`: (Optional) Path in bucket
    - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Environment variable set to file path pointing to service account credentials

All five replica `scheme`s have the following additional options:

- `retention`: (Optional)  The amount of time that snapshot & WAL files will be kept. After the retention period, a new snapshot will be created and the old one will be removed. WAL files that exist before the oldest snapshot will also be removed. Defaults to `24h`.
- `retention_check_interval`: (Optional) Specifies how often Bencher will check if retention needs to be enforced. Defaults to `1h`.
- `snapshot_interval`: (Optional) Specifies how often new snapshots will be created. This is used to reduce the time to restore since newer snapshots will have fewer WAL frames to apply. Retention still applies to these snapshots. If you do not set a snapshot interval then a new snapshot will be created whenever retention is performed. Retention occurs every 24 hours by default.
- `validation_interval`: (Optional) When specified, Bencher will automatically restore and validate that the data on the replica matches the local copy. Disabled by default. Enabling this may significantly increase the cost of running Bencher as most cloud services charge for downloads.
- `sync_interval`: (Optional) Frequency in which frames are pushed to the replica. Defaults to `1s`. Increasing frequency can increase cloud storage costs significantly.

|    replicas[replica]     | \{ ... \} |   ---   |   Yes    |                             Specifies a replica object.                             |
| replicas[replica].scheme |   "s3"    |   ---   |   Yes    | Specifies the replication scheme. For all other `replica` keys, see the list above. |
