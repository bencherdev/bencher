### `--branch-start-point <BRANCH>`

<br />

Use the specified Branch name, slug, or UUID as the [Start Point][start point] for the [`branch`](#--branch-branch) option.
For GitHub this is usually [the `base` branch for a Pull Request][github base],
and for GitLab this is usually [the `target` branch for a Merge Request][gitlab target].
The primary use case for `--branch-start-point` is [Statistical Continuous Benchmarking](/docs/how-to/track-benchmarks/#statistical-continuous-benchmarking).

- If the specified Start Point is an empty string, then this option is ignored.
- If `branch` does not exist, it will be created using this Start Point.
- If `branch` does exist and the Start Point is the same, then this option is ignored.
- If `branch` does exist and the Start Point is different,
  the old version of `branch` will be renamed
  and a new `branch` will be created using this updated Start Point.
- If `branch` does not exist and the Start Point does not exist,
  then the `branch` will be created without any historical data.
- If `branch` does exist and the Start Point does not exist,
  then this option is ignored.

If a new `branch` is created with a Start Point,
then all the data and Thresholds from the specified Start Point are copied over.

For example, if `feature_branch` does not yet exist, but `main` does exist and has historical data.
Then using `--branch feature_branch --branch-start-point main` would:
1. Create a new Branch named `feature_branch`
2. Copy of all the data and Thresholds from `main` to `feature_branch`
3. `bencher run` would proceed using `feature_branch`

> 🐰 Note: Whenever using environment variables they should be wrapped in double quotes (ie `--branch-start-point "$MY_BRANCH_ENV_VAR"`),
> if you would like `bencher run` to not error when `MY_BRANCH_ENV_VAR` is undefined.
