#### Spec
A Spec is a hardware specification that describes the resources available to a Testbed.
It includes the CPU architecture, number of CPUs, memory size, disk size, and whether the environment has network access.
Specs are server-scoped, so the same Spec can be shared across multiple Testbeds.
