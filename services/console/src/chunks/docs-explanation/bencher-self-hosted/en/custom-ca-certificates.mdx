## Custom CA certificates

By default, the `bencher` CLI loads certificates from the bundled [`webpki-roots` crate][webpki-roots].
The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla,
and including them in `bencher` improves portability and performance.
This is especially true on macOS, where reading the system trust store incurs a significant delay.

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store,
especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root that's included in your system's certificate store
for a mandatory proxy or self-signed Bencher Self-Hosted connections.
To instruct `bencher` to use the system's trust store, run `bencher` with
[the `--native-tls` flag][native tls].

If a direct path to the certificate is required,
set the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable to the path of the certificate bundle,
to instruct `bencher` to use that file instead of the system's trust store.
This is often the case in CI environments where the system's trust store is not available.

If client certificate authentication (mTLS) is desired,
set the `SSL_CLIENT_CERT` environment variable to the path of the PEM formatted file
containing the certificate followed by the private key.

Finally, if you're using a setup in which you want to trust a self-signed certificate
or otherwise disable certificate verification,
you can instruct `bencher` to allow insecure connections to dedicated hosts via
[the `--insecure-host` flag][insecure host].
This flag is only applicable to HTTPS connections, as HTTP connections are inherently insecure.

**WARNING**: nly use `--insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources,
as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to [man-in-the-middle attacks][wikipedia mitm].
