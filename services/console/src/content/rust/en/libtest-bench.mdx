All three are [supported by Bencher](/docs/explanation/adapters/). So why choose libtest bench?
It may be a good idea if you are trying to limit the external dependencies of your project
and your project is already using the `nightly` toolchain.
Outside of that, I would suggest using either Criterion or Iai depending on your use case.

### Install Rust `nightly`

With all that said, we're going to use libtest bench, so let's set our Rust toolchain to `nightly`.
Create a `rust-toolchain.toml` file in the root of your `game` project, next to `Cargo.toml`.

<RustToolchainRustBenchCode />

Your directory structure should now look like this:

<RustToolchainRustBenchTree />

Once that is complete, rerun `cargo run`.
It should take minute for the new, nightly toolchain to install
before rerunning and giving you the same output as before.

## Benchmarking FizzBuzz

In order to use the unstable libtest crate we need to enable the `test` feature for our code and import the `test` crate. Add the following to the _very top_ of `main.rs`:

<TestCreateRustBenchCode />

Now we're ready to add our first benchmark!
Add the following to the _very bottom_ of `main.rs`:

<BenchPlayGameRustBenchCode />

- Create a module named `benchmarks` and set the
  [compiler configuration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#the-cfg-attribute)
  to [`test` mode](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest).
- Import the `Bencher` benchmark runner. (🐰 Hey, cool name!)
- Import our `play_game` function.
- Create a benchmark named `bench_play_game` that takes in a mutable reference to `Bencher`.
- Set the `#[bench]` attribute to indicate that `bench_play_game` is a benchmark.
- Use the `Bencher` instance (`b`) to run our macro-benchmark several times.
- Run our macro-benchmark inside of a "black box" so the compiler doesn't optimize our code.
- Iterate from `1` to `100` inclusively.
- For each number, call `play_game`.

Now we're ready to benchmark our code, run `cargo bench`:

<BenchPlayGameRustBenchOutput />

> 🐰 Lettuce turnip the beet! We've got our first benchmark metrics!

Finally, we can rest our weary developer heads...
Just kidding, our users want a new feature!

## Benchmarking FizzBuzzFibonacci

Now we can rerun our benchmark:

<BenchPlayGameFibonacciRustBenchOutput />

Scrolling back through our terminal history,
we can make an eyeball comparison between the performance of our FizzBuzz and FizzBuzzFibonacci games: `4,879 ns` vs `22,167 ns`.
Your numbers will be a little different than mine.
However, the difference between the two games is likely in the 5x range.
That seems good to me! Especially for adding a feature as fancy sounding as _Fibonacci_ to our game.
The kids will love it!

<OnFire />

<BenchPlayGameOnFireRustBenchCode />

- A micro-benchmark `bench_play_game_100` for playing the game with the number one hundred (`100`)
- A micro-benchmark `bench_play_game_1_000_000` for playing the game with the number one million (`1_000_000`)

When I ran it, I got this:

<BenchPlayGameOnFireRustBenchOutputStart />

Wait for it... wait for it...

<BenchPlayGameOnFireRustBenchOutput />

What! `439 ns` x `1,000` should be `439,000 ns` not `9,586,977 ns` 🤯
Even though I got my Fibonacci sequence code functionally correct, I must have a performance bug in there somewhere.

<FizzBuzzFibonacciFixRust />

Now lets rerun those benchmarks and see how we did:

<BenchPlayGameFixRustBenchOutput />

Oh, wow! Our `bench_play_game` benchmark is back down to around where it was for the original FizzBuzz.
I wish I could remember exactly what that score was. It's been three weeks though.
My terminal history doesn't go back that far.
But I think it's close!

The `bench_play_game_100` benchmark is down nearly 10x, `439 ns` to `46 ns`.
And the `bench_play_game_1_000_000` benchmark is down more than 10,000x! `9,586,977 ns` to `53 ns`!

> 🐰 Hey, at least we caught this performance bug before it made it to production... oh, right. Nevermind...
